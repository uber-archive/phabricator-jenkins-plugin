     * Languages like Kotlin/Scala which can have multiple top level classes in a file. For such classes,
     * (package path + source file name) will not match where they are actually present in the filesystem.
     * So this method does two separate marches 1) with just file name and 2) with package name + sourcefile name.
     * Multiple classes with same name and different packages will match correctly. In case a full match is not
     * possible, we fall back to file name match. We only check against files included as part of a diff which means
     * that the possibility of a bad match is very unlikely (only if two files with same name are touched as part of
     * the diff), but that is the best we can accomplish.
